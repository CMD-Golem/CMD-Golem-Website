	<summary>Important technical stuff</summary>
	<div>
		<p>Be aware that other data packs and mods which change the functionality of containers and doors could break the functionality of this pack. In the case of containers, this could lead to loss of items.</p>
		<p>Never kill all entities in the world, since the locked status is stored in special entities.</p>
		<p>A server admin can unlock someone elses locked blocks with an Admin Key:</p>
		<code>/function keylock:craft/admin_key</code>
		<p>If you can't unlock a container or door anymore, first try to break it. If it replaces itself you can use an Admin Key to unlock it. If this doesn't work for your container and you need your items back, you should use this command to restore them:</p>
		<code>/function keylock:container/repair with block &#60;container position&#62;</code>
		<p>You won't be able to use the this command if you lock the container with the missing items with new items in it again. The items itself aren't stored in the special entity, but in storage. The file is located in the data folder of your world and is called command_storage_keylock.dat.</p>
